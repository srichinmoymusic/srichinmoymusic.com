<p>by Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p><em>His soulful music expressed<br />                     His aspiration,<br />                     His realisation<br />                     And his oneness<br />                     With the Universal Consciousness.</em></p>
<p><em>God’s favourite sound<br />                     Is the sound of His inner Music.<br />                     This inner Music <br />                     Is the music of earth’s transformation<br />                     And humanity’s life-perfection.</em></p>
<p>It is quite possible to be both a musician and a Yogi. In                      Mother India there have been many saints, sages and spiritual                      Masters who were blessed with divine music. Their musical                      talent did not interfere with their God-realisation, and even                      after achieving God-realisation, their musical talents did                      not leave them. </p>
<p>Yoga means union, inseparable oneness with God. A Yogi is                      one who has established conscious union with God. He can easily                      become a musician because in his inseparable oneness with                      God, he can do anything he wants. But a Yogi has to wait for                      God’s Will. If it is God’s Will, he will become                      a musician; or if it is God’s Will, he will become something                      else. Otherwise, he will just remain with his own lofty realisation                      and oneness; he will reveal and manifest the highest Peace,                      Light and Truth the way the Supreme wants him to. </p>
<p>When an individual realises God, he and God are not different                      beings; they are one, like a tiny drop and the vast ocean.                      In the same way, sometimes the soul responds to music. The                      soul thrills to music; it just melts and becomes one. </p>
<p>A Yogi’s qualities and a musician’s qualities                      can go side by side, provided the Yogi has the capacity and                      inherent talent for music. Even if the Yogi spends a very                      short time in the musical world, he can be a very good musician,                      but it will take infinitely more time for a musician to become                      a Yogi. </p>
<p>Spiritual Masters who have musical capacity can eventually                      show the world at large that inner music can be played outwardly                      and appreciated by the world. Inner music one can hear and                      one can create while one is meditating. We can hear inner                      music through aspiration. What is inner music? We have learned                      from the Indian Vedas that this music is the mother tongue                      of humanity, the language of the soul. It is through music                      that the Divine in us gets the opportunity to manifest itself                      here on earth. </p>
<p>When a musician’s spiritual capacity becomes most powerful,                      he doesn’t even have to speak. Others will just look                      at his face and see some illumination. </p>
<p>When a spiritual Master plays his music, through his music                      he enters into the heart and soul of the audience. At the                      same time, he is bringing down light from above. He is not                      just playing on an instrument. He is receiving something from                      the higher world and then offering it to the world at large.                      In an hour, thousands of people can feel this higher light                      as their very own. So music has the opportunity, the capacity,                      to claim the universe as its very own. </p>
<h2>Music and Religion</h2>
<p> Music and religion are like the obverse and reverse of the                      same reality-coin. Music in its purest sense is religion and                      religion in its purest sense is music. This music-religion,                      this code of life, this universal language of the soul, can                      only be offered; it cannot be purchased or sold. Music and                      religion are for the seekers, for the music-lovers, for the                      truth-servers. Money-power or earthly name and fame cannot                      lord it over these two immortal realities, these two earthly                      and heavenly treasures.</p>
<p> The source of true music and the source of true religion                      will always remain the same, and that source is a cry, a birthless                      and deathless cry — an eternal hunger. It is a hunger                      not for one’s own satisfaction, but for God’s                      Satisfaction in God’s own way. When music and religion                      come from this source, only then will the message and beauty                      of music and the message and beauty of religion be divinely                      illumining and fulfilling. </p>
<p>The Mogul Emperor Akbar employed the great musician Tansen                      in his court. One day when Akbar was deeply appreciating Tansen,                      Tansen said, “I am not a great musician.”</p>
<p> Akbar said, “You are not only a great musician; you                      are the best musician.”</p>
<p> But Tansen said, “No, my Guru, my teacher, Haridas,                      is by far the best.”</p>
<p> The Emperor said, “Then bring him to my palace!”</p>
<p> Tansen replied, “No, he will not come. He does not                      care for name and fame. He plays only for God. God’s                      Compassion is his sole reward.”</p>
<p> Akbar said, “Then I will have to go to him. Take me                      to him.” </p>
<p>Tansen agreed, but he told Akbar, “You cannot go as                      the Emperor. You have to go in the guise of my servant, my                      slave.”</p>
<p> So Akbar went to Tansen’s teacher as a servant, and                      Tansen begged his teacher to play for Akbar. Unfortunately,                      Haridas was not in the mood to play. Then a brilliant idea                      struck Tansen’s mind. He started playing, deliberately                      making many mistakes. Haridas could not believe his eyes and                      ears. How could his best student make such deplorable mistakes?                      Out of great surprise and shock, he started playing in order                      to correct his student. In this way the Emperor came to realise                      that Tansen’s teacher was indeed far superior to Tansen.</p>
<p> When they came back to the palace, Akbar asked Tansen, “How                      is it that you cannot play as soulfully as your teacher does?”</p>
<p> Tansen replied, “I play for name and fame. I play                      for you. He plays for God. Here is the difference. If I played                      for God—for God in you, for God in everyone—only                      then would my music be supernatural, heavenly, supremely soulful                      and perfect. But I play for money-power, for name and fame.                      How do you expect me to play the way my teacher does?”                    </p>
<p><em>Can spiritual music inspire non-spiritual listeners?</em></p>
<p>Spiritual music can inspire non-spiritual listeners in the                      same way that God inspires unaspiring humanity. In the beginning                      there was darkness; then there was light. Because God has                      always inspired unaspiring humanity, this light is continually                      increasing. If some individuals are not aspiring right now,                      it is the bounden duty of those who are already awakened to                      inspire them in the same way that the Supreme, out of His                      infinite bounty, inspired and continues to inspire the ones                      who are now well established in the world of aspiration.</p>
<p> Each individual has a heart. Spirituality is in the heart,                      with the heart and for the heart. It is only a matter of time                      before the heart responds to spiritual music, which embodies                      the beauty and purity of music in its pristine form and in                      infinite measure.<br />                     A great musician can add to the inner cry of the person who                      practises a spiritual life. And if the musician himself believes                      in God wholeheartedly, then his music can be of tremendous                      help to his own spiritual practice. </p>
<p> <em>What do you concentrate on when you play music?</em></p>
<p>Most of the time I concentrate on the soul of the particular                      piece that I am playing. Each song has a soul, so I concentrate                      on the soul of each song. Sometimes I concentrate on the soul                      of a particular melody that I feel is very haunting; and I                      try to reveal and manifest the divine beauty of that melody.                    </p>
<p><em>You have created thousands of paintings, poems and songs.                      Where does this endless fountain of creativity come from?</em></p>
<p>This endless fountain of creativity comes from only one Source,                      and that Source I call the unconditional Compassion of my                      Lord Beloved Supreme. He bestows upon me His unconditional                      Compassion-Light and according to my receptivity He creates                      in and through me. </p>
<p> <em>Is there art in other worlds besides earth?</em></p>
<p>Yes, there is art in other worlds and other planes of consciousness                      apart from earth, but this art is not for manifestation. This                      art is something that exists for its own sake. It comes spontaneously.                      Here on earth, whenever we do something, even if we just exist,                      we do it for the sake of others. A tree has flowers and fruits.                      Even if the tree doesn’t want to give me anything, still                      I can climb up its trunk and eat its fruits or pluck its flowers,                      or I can just enjoy its shade if I want to. But in the other                      worlds it is not like that. There you can appreciate the beauty                      of something, but you can’t claim it or use it for your                      own purpose. Here on earth, as soon as art is created, you                      can steal it with force or buy it or plead with the artist                      to give it to you. In the other worlds, you can at most appreciate                      it, but you can’t capture the art, you can’t claim                      it, you can’t acquire it, because it is not manifested.</p>
<p> In other worlds you see the Gandharvas—the celestial                      musicians like Narada, who is the most prominent one. There                      is a particular world where a constant assembly of musicians                      is held. There is also a world for artists in the inner world.                      There are some artists who have not taken incarnation but                      just remain in this inner world. Again, some great artists,                      spiritual artists from earth, go to this world to enjoy it                      when they leave the body. </p>
<blockquote><p> <em>O Master-Musician, <br />                       Tune me for life again.<br />                       The awakening of new music<br />                       My heart wants to become.<br />                       My life is now mingled<br />                       In ecstasy’s height.</em></p>
