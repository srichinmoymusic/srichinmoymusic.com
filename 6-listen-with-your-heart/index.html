<p><em>When we sing,<br />                     We embody and become<br />                     The power of music.<br />                     This power has a free access<br />                     To the Universal Heart.</em></p>
<p><em> Let us not try to understand music<br />                     With our mind.<br />                     Let us not even try to feel it<br />                     With our heart.<br />                     Let us simply and spontaneously<br />                     Allow the music-bird to fly<br />                     In our heart-sky.<br />                     While flying, it will unconditionally<br />                     Reveal to us<br />                     What it has and what it is.<br />                     What it has<br />                     Is Immortality’s message<br />                     And what it is<br />                     Is Eternity’s passage.</em></p>
<p> God’s Music is heard by each individual according                      to his own capacity of receptivity. God plays the same Music,                      but it sounds one way to one person and totally different                      to another. When a professor gives a talk, there will be many                      students in the same classroom. Each student will understand                      the professor’s talk differently. Because of his inner                      capacity, the best student in the class will understand much                      more than the worst student. God’s Music is heard, valued,                      understood and felt in a specific way according to the listener’s                      own capacity of receptivity. </p>
<p>God has created two kinds of music-lovers. One kind will                      try to study and understand music, most of the time on a mental                      level. These music-lovers enjoy music in a mental way. Again,                      there are some seekers who have no musical training, but they                      seek the music that is deep within. They enjoy music in a                      psychic way. The music that they hear at times far surpasses                      the music that others study. <br />                     If you can identify yourself with music, at that time you                      become the source, the composer. Also, when you listen to                      spiritual music and identify yourself with the singers, if                      the music is being sung very soulfully, this is nothing short                      of your own prayer and meditation.</p>
<p><em>How can we learn to hear the inner music? </em></p>
<p>Through constant prayer and meditation we can learn to hear                      the inner music. We have to pray soulfully to God to grant                      us light, abundant light, so that when we dive deep within                      we can hear His Message without being hindered by our doubting                      mind. The deeper we can dive, the sooner our doubting mind                      will leave us for good. So it is through prayer that we can                      listen to the dictates of our soul, dictates that embody music                      pristine in purity, light and delight. </p>
<p> <em>What is the best way to become one with soulful music?</em></p>
<p>The best way to become one with soulful music is to have                      the firm inner conviction that while you are breathing in,                      the breath is immediately entering directly into your soul.                      And with the breath, you have to feel that the Universal Consciousness,                      divine Reality, divine Truth is also entering. Then, when                      you breathe out, try to feel that you are breathing out the                      ignorance that is covering your soul. Feel that the veils                      of ignorance are being lifted and discarded. If you can consciously                      imagine and feel this, it is the best way to become one with                      soulful music.</p>
<p><em>What role will music play in bringing about world oneness?</em></p>
<p>Music will play a most important role in bringing about world                      oneness, for music embodies the Universal Heart, the oneness-heart.                      Music transcends the barriers of nations, nationalities and                      religions. Music embodies universal light and universal truth,                      and music also embodies the oneness-reality which we see in                      universal love, universal light, universal awareness and universal                      wakefulness. Universal wakefulness we see inside all music.                      Music has to play a most important role in bringing about                      world oneness, for music is the connecting link between the                      One and the many and between the many and the One. <br />                     It is through music that the universal feeling of oneness                      can be achieved in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p> <em>I was at a concert and I felt a connection with the                      violinist.</em></p>
<p>In this case you established your own inner oneness with                      the Source in him. On the outer plane he was playing; on the                      inner plane the soul was playing in and through you. You were                      entering into that particular musician; he was entering into                      the Source. From there the music was being played. It happens                      quite a few times when a seeker in the audience enters into                      the Source. The seeker who is in the audience can easily establish                      his oneness with the Source if he feels that he is being utilised                      by the Source. One is active; the other one is silent. The                      one that is playing is active and you at that time are silent.                      You are not merely a silent listener, but a silent participant.</p>
