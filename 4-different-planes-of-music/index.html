<p>by Sri Chinmoy</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Human music<br />                       Feeds the vital of mankind.<br />                       Divine music<br />                       Serves the heart of mankind.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A seeker-singer feels that if he has no music, his heart                      is soulless, his life is useless, his goal is worthless. </p>
<p>Why? Because music is the oneness-aspiration of humanity.                      Oneness without a soulful melody is blind, deaf and useless.                    </p>
<p> Again, a melody without fruitful oneness is just a body                      without a soul. </p>
<p>Without oneness-aspiration, humanity can never achieve perfection.                    </p>
<p>Without perfection, satisfaction will always remain a far                      cry. </p>
<p> If there is no satisfaction, then life can have no value                      whatsoever. </p>
<p> It is for satisfaction that we aspire. It is for satisfaction                      that we try to perfect ourselves. </p>
<p> Satisfaction is the only reality-existence that both God                      and man need. </p>
<p> Soulful music not only has the answer, but is the answer                      to this need.</p>
<p> [Note: The vital is the web of desires, motives, drives                      and emotions. It can include—in its higher and illumined                      aspect—aspiration, or the quest for illumination and                      perfection. But unless the term ‘higher vital’                      or ‘illumined vital’ is used, the vital usually                      refers to worldly desires and the quest for possessions and                      power. ]</p>
<p>The seven notes in the scale correspond to the seven higher                      worlds. Each note comes down from a specific inner world.                      Each world has a music of its own and a note of its own. The                      higher worlds have a music that awakens us, inspires us, illumines                      us, perfects us and fulfils us. The music of the higher worlds                      constantly comes to us as the harbinger of the highest Height,                      whereas the music of the lower worlds naturally comes to us                      as a messenger of destruction. </p>
<p> It is not only the higher and lower worlds that have a music                      of their own; each individual has his own music, each movement                      has its own music, each action has its own music. Each time                      we breathe in and breathe out, there is music. When we do                      not pay attention to the inner depth of the action, we do                      not hear the music. If we do pay adequate attention to each                      action, then inside the very depth of that action we are bound                      to hear music. Unless we hear music inside each action, the                      action is lifeless.</p>
<p> Next to meditation is music. But it has to be soulful music,                      the music that stirs and elevates our aspiring consciousness.                      When we play soulful music, psychic music, then immediately                      we are transported to the highest realm of consciousness.                    </p>
<p> This music from the soul wants to express and fulfil itself                      through the heart. But here a problem arises. When the soul                      starts to play its music in the heart, the doubting mind does                      not allow the heart to listen. Then gradually the vital becomes                      more powerful than the pure heart.</p>
<p> The music of the lower vital destroys our subtle nerves                      and wants to devour the heart’s divine qualities. The                      vital has been predominant in the world for quite a few years.                      But lower vital music will not always predominate on earth.                      The world also has a soul. Eventually, the music of the soul                      will replace the music of the vital. Today the vital is nourished                      and the soul is starving. But when there are more aspiring                      people than unaspiring people on earth, naturally the inner,                      soul-elevating music will replace the music of the impure,                      unlit and obscure vital.</p>
<p> When we play vital music, we starve our soul and feed our                      body. The creator is like the mother and humanity is the child.                      When the creator plays vital music, the mother is drinking                      something, but the child is starving for something else, for                      milk. But when the creator plays spiritual music, both the                      mother and the child are drinking nectar at the same time.                      Even looking at the mother’s face, the child will be                      able to drink nectar. The very fact that the mother is drinking                      nectar is enough for the child.</p>
<h2> The Soul’s Light and Delight</h2>
<p> Soulful music offers delight rather than vital excitement.                      Vital excitement is one thing and the soul’s delight                      is something else. The soul’s delight is most powerful,                      most intense but, at the same time, it does not create any                      kind of undivine, sensational pleasure in the body. It just                      transports; it carries the entire being into the Highest like                      a balloon and then, when the balloon breaks, you are swimming                      in the sea of bliss. </p>
<p> Soulful music is the music that immediately elevates our                      consciousness to the Absolute, to the Highest. But ordinary                      music, vital music, may bring our consciousness down. For                      a fleeting second or a few hours, we get a kind of pleasure;                      but then this pleasure takes us into a lower vital consciousness.                      Soulful music takes us into the world of aspiration. From                      aspiration we enter into the world of realisation, where our                      inner existence is flooded with light and delight.</p>
<h2> The Universal Consciousness</h2>
<p> Soulful music is the music that wants to eventually transform                      our consciousness. It carries us into the Universal Consciousness                      and makes us feel that we are in tune with the highest, with                      the deepest, with the farthest. It also makes us feel that                      God Himself is the Supreme Musician.</p>
<p> A soulful sound gives immediate joy and immediate self-expansion.                      This self-expansion is not egocentric; it is something divine,                      something supreme, something universal. A soulful sound is                      like music that is produced for all. With it the ‘I’                      goes away. In soulful sound there is no ‘I’. It                      is all ‘we’. Other sounds are produced by the                      individual for the individual, but a soulful sound is produced                      by the Universal in us, by the Eternal in us, by the Absolute                      in us. The soulful sound is of Eternity and for Infinity and                      Immortality. This is how we distinguish the soulful sound                      from other sounds. Other sounds have their originality in                      individuality, but soulful sounds have their originality in                      universality.</p>
<h2> The Divine Musician</h2>
<p> The human musician plays in order to become great. The divine                      musician becomes good first and then plays divinely, while                      soulfully and unconditionally offering the results to his                      Beloved Supreme. </p>
<p> You have to know that if you play music from the vital plane,                      you are only fooling yourself. The music that is inspired                      from around or below the navel is the vital music. Music that                      comes from the heart is psychic music, and the music that                      comes from the inmost recesses of the heart, from very deep                      within, comes from the soul. If we can feel that it is not                      our voice, not our fingers, but some reality deep inside our                      heart which is expressing itself, then we will know that it                      is the soul’s music.</p>
<p> When we play soulful music, we elevate our consciousness                      most rapidly. Soulful music is a form of aspiration, a form                      of meditation. All those who are seekers of the infinite Truth                      will naturally play soulful music; and when they play soulful                      music, they have to know that they are consciously running                      towards their destined goal.</p>
<h2> Music and Consciousness</h2>
<p> Water symbolises consciousness. Consciousness, like water,                      is neutral. What we put inside water is of paramount importance.                      If it is something harmless, sweet and divine, then we will                      get joy. But if we put something undivine, poisonous and destructive                      in the water, then naturally when we drink it we shall die.                      What we mix with the water before drinking it is entirely                      up to us. When you hear music, if it lifts your consciousness,                      then you will know that it is spiritual music. Sometimes the                      musician is aspiring and also he is playing spiritual music;                      at that time you are very fortunate, because you get both.</p>
<p> Musicians should give something new; they should give the                      world music that comes directly from the soul, music that                      will help humanity raise its consciousness—not the things                      that have been known for many, many years, but the things                      that people have never seen or felt or heard. </p>
<p> Vital music played its role, especially in the Western hemisphere.                      But this kind of music is not the soul’s music. The                      soul’s music is something totally different. The world                      will eventually appreciate, admire and adore that music. </p>
<p> Music is of God and for God, not of the vital world and                      for the vital world. Real music, divine music, takes you back                      to God, the Supreme Musician.</p>
<p> <em>Can listening to music raise one’s consciousness?</em></p>
<p> If you listen to and identify yourself with spiritual music,                      music from the heart and soul, naturally it will raise your                      consciousness. But if you listen to ordinary vital music,                      then it will lower your consciousness.</p>
<p> Soulful music already has its own height. While you are                      listening, you identify with it, so like a magnet it pulls                      you up. Already the height is there.</p>
<p> If somebody has already gone to the top floor of a building,                      it means that there is a staircase. You have to identify yourself                      with the staircase and also with the person who has already                      climbed up it. Then only will he be able to show you how he                      climbed up and where the staircase is. Appreciation means                      identification. If you become one with the staircase and also                      with the person who has created the staircase for you in his                      music, then you also can reach the top floor. </p>
<p> <em>In years to come, what songs will have the greatest                      influence on humanity?</em></p>
<p> The songs that will have the greatest influence are those                      that come directly from the soul and immediately are accepted                      by the aspiring heart, vital, mind and body. Sometimes you                      can soulfully sing most soulful songs, but only the aspiring                      heart accepts the songs. The doubting mind or the intellectual                      mind finds it very difficult to appreciate anything. The aggressive                      or restless vital and the sombre or sleeping body also find                      it very difficult to appreciate the songs. But when a soulful                      song is sung soulfully and, at the same time, it is appreciated                      by the immediate members of the inner family–the body,                      vital, mind and heart–on the soul level on which it                      is sung, then it will definitely have the greatest influence                      on humanity.</p>
<p> Sometimes you sing a song most soulfully from the heart                      level, let us say. If it is not appreciated on the heart level,                      if it is just appreciated on the mind level or the vital level                      or the physical level, then one does not get the utmost joy,                      inspiration and satisfaction from it. In order to get the                      utmost satisfaction, one has to reach the level from which                      the song is sung and appreciate it there before it comes down                      to a lower level. If it is from the heart level, then one                      has to attain the heart level in order to appreciate it. One                      can also appreciate it from a lower rung, but it will not                      be as effective.</p>
<p><em>In your books you say that vital music can be detrimental                      to our spiritual life. But sometimes when I listen to music                      that is very lively and up tempo, I feel I get joy. It is                      not what you would call spiritual music; it is just energetic                      music. Do you consider this kind of energetic music detrimental?</em></p>
<p>There are two aspects of the vital. There is the dynamic                      vital and the tempting and tempted vital. When Sri Chaitanya                      and his disciples used to sing and dance in the street, they                      were not manifesting the tempting or tempted vital. No, it                      was the dynamic vital, which is full of enthusiasm to scatter                      its dynamic energy all around. The vital that is energised                      in a pure way—the vital that is trying to elevate the                      consciousness of those around it—is absolutely necessary.                      This kind of eagerness, enthusiasm and dynamism is very good.</p>
<p> But there is another kind of vital that also has dynamic                      energy but that brings the consciousness low, lower, lowest.                      Easily your mind and your heart can see the difference. I                      do not want to use the terms ‘rock and roll’ or                      ‘jazz’. What do I know about those things? But                      if you want to make a comparison between music that comes                      from the dynamic vital and music that comes from the tempting                      or tempted vital, easily you can see the difference. From                      this other kind of music, you may get enthusiasm, but it is                      not the pure enthusiasm that will elevate your consciousness                      or spiritual life. While you are in that world of music, you                      will notice your consciousness going down, or you will find                      that it has gone down. </p>
<p> Sometimes we are not aware when our consciousness is being                      lowered. It is only when our consciousness has reached the                      abysmal abyss that we see what has happened. While we are                      climbing a little way down the tree, we think, “This                      is nothing, nothing! I can easily climb back up.” But                      we cannot. Once we start to descend, we continue to descend.                      We cannot stay in one place; the law of gravity takes over                      and we fall to the bottom.</p>
<p> So you have to see what kind of vital energy the music has—whether                      it is taking you upward or bringing you downward. You have                      to be the judge.</p>
<p><em>In today’s world, it seems increasingly difficult                      for artists and musicians to survive. Is there any advice                      you have for the multitude of struggling artists? And what                      is it that determines the difference between whether they                      are truly successful or not?</em></p>
<p>I am a Truth-seeker and God-lover. In my case, if a musician                      or an artist can waken the consciousness of the audience to                      a higher height, then I feel that he is successful; he has                      made a tremendous contribution to the world at large. But                      again there are some musicians—and in no way am I criticising                      them; that is what they like and also what the audience likes—who                      create a kind of excitement in the vital region. Then it does                      not go any farther. It only touches the exciting vital and                      stimulates the vital, and it all ends in eventual frustration.                      Whereas if some musicians play soulful music and some singers                      sing soulfully, they are bound to awaken the consciousness                      of the audience. After all, each individual who comes to listen                      to songs or to hear music comes to get something abiding—the                      lasting joy that inspires them to see and feel something in                      themselves that is absolutely new and unprecedented &#8211; unprecedented                      joy, unprecedented love.</p>
<p> The present-day musicians are the musicians who play vital                      music. They create lightning excitement for the music-lovers.                      But excitement is not the answer to humanity’s evolution.                      It is the soulful awakening that is of paramount importance.                      Soulful music awakens the heart; the soul is already awakened.                      The soul is always awakened, but the soul tries to manifest                      God’s Beauty, Light and Power in and through its members—the                      body, vital, mind and heart.</p>
<p> So it depends on the individual musician. If he wants to                      awaken the consciousness of his listeners and give them something                      divine and immortal, then he has to enter into their aspiring                      lives on the strength of his own aspiration—which is                      his offering through his musical talents.</p>
<p> Each type of music has access to a particular realm. Vital                      music cannot be used as a vehicle for spiritual growth—it                      is like knocking on the wrong door. When musicians play vital                      music, I don’t think they are meditating on the soul.                      They are aiming at excitement and noise, and a kind of, I                      do not want to say ‘confusion’, but a kind of                      destruction. If you play soulful music, then you have to enter                      into the soulfulness of the music and also enter into the                      soulfulness of the audience. If my goal is situated in the                      north, then I will only get whatever is in the north; I will                      not get what is in the south. </p>
<p> Sincere God-lovers will not be satisfied when they hear                      music that is all excitement and vital exuberance. They will                      be satisfied only when there is something very soulful, very                      pure, very haunting, so that at every moment they feel they                      are entering into a higher realm of consciousness. This higher                      realm of consciousness is their goal, whereas other musicians                      who are playing vital music are not thinking of the goal as                      the highest or the greatest need in their life, nor does the                      audience think of that highest goal. </p>
<p> <em>At my job I have to work with unspiritual music. How                      can I be creative and not be affected by it?</em></p>
<p>The best thing you can do is try not to be affected by the                      unspiritual music and remain in a high consciousness. Your                      best creation is not to be affected by something which is                      trying to lower your consciousness. Your creation is to maintain                      your spiritual height. If you can remain in your aspiration,                      that aspiration itself is creation. </p>
<p> <em>I have been earning my living through music for about                      ten years, but now it is very difficult for me to take money                      for my art. I feel that I only want to serve God through music.</em></p>
<p> You have to know that money can either be a divine power,                      or it can be misused. With a knife we can cut a fruit and                      share it with our brothers and sisters, or we can stab others.                      Money as such is not bad, only we have to know how we are                      getting it and using it. We shall not get money by using foul                      means, and we shall not misuse money: this should be our attitude.                      Why should it be difficult for you to accept money for your                      music? Money can be God’s blessing if you use it properly.                    </p>
<p> You have to know how you are earning your money. If you                      are singing lower vital, emotional songs and creating excitement,                      and if you feel that that is the only way you can earn money,                      it is absurd. You have to maintain your own standard. You                      will do something that will elevate the consciousness of others,                      not stimulate excitement. Vital music stimulates, whereas                      the soul’s music, psychic music, elevates. </p>
<p> If you earn money by illumining and elevating somebody’s                      consciousness and with that money you support yourself or                      do something good and divine, then how can anybody blame you?                      But you have to know how you are getting the money, from whom                      you are getting it and how you are using it. If you take all                      these things into consideration, then money-power need not                      be a stumbling block. Money-power is also God’s power,                      but it has to be used properly. </p>
