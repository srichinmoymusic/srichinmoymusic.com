<p><em>God the Supreme Musician<br />                     Offers His Music of Peace.<br />                     Man the divine audience<br />                     Offers his peace-receptivity.</em></p>
<p><em> My earth-songs<br />                     Devotedly find me.</em></p>
<p><em>My Heaven-songs<br />                     Soulfully illumine me.</em></p>
<p><em>My God-songs<br />                     Triumphantly immortalise me.</em></p>
<p>God is the Supreme Musician. It is He who is playing with                      us, on us and in us. We cannot separate God from His Music.                      The universal Consciousness is constantly being played by                      the Supreme Himself, and is constantly growing into the Supreme                      Music. God the Creator is the Supreme Musician and God the                      creation is the supreme Music. The Musician and His Music                      can never be separated. His creation is being fulfilled. The                      Music Supreme feels its fulfilment only when it consciously                      becomes one with the Supreme, the Creator Himself. Through                      music, God is offering the message of unity in multiplicity                      and also the message of multiplicity in unity.</p>
<p> Music is God’s Dream. God is dreaming at every moment                      through music. His Dream is called the cosmic Reality, the                      universal Reality. From the highest point of view, music is                      not mere words; it is not a concept, not an idea. Music is                      Reality in its highest form. God is playing the supreme Music                      in and through us, His chosen instruments. He is playing on                      us in His own Way. He does not need any human instruments                      or words to convey His Message, to convey Himself. This He                      can do in silence without taking any help from the sound-world.                      God created sound in order to know outwardly what He is inwardly.                      Inwardly He knows what He is, but if He does not outwardly                      manifest His inner Divinity then the world cannot accept Him,                      cannot realise Him. So He created sound just for the sake                      of His own manifestation.</p>
<p> <em>God-Music purifies our body.<br />                     God-Music strengthens our soul.<br />                     God-Music expedites our life-liberation,<br />                     God-realisation and love-manifestation.</em></p>
<p><em> Be a pioneer<br />                     In God’s Music-World.<br />                     Your dedication-life<br />                     Can offer God-Music<br />                     To many receptive hearts.</em></p>
<p><em>God’s Music<br />                     Comes from God’s Heart<br />                     Of Silence-Delight.</em></p>
<p><em>God’s Songs<br />                     Come from God’s Eye<br />                     Of Compassion-Love</em></p>
