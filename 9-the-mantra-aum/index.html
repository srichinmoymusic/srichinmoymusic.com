<p><em>Remembrance of God’s Name<br />                     Is perfection-sky.<br />                     Repetition of God’s Name<br />                     Is satisfaction-sun.</em></p>
<p>In the inner life, mantras play a considerable role. A mantra                      is a syllable, group of syllables or a sentence divinely surcharged                      with power. This power can be utilised for a divine purpose                      or for an undivine purpose once it is attained through chanting.                      There are many, many Sanskrit mantras, and everybody has his                      own mantra. In the Indian scriptures it is said that if you                      want mental illumination, if you want purity, or if you want                      some other quality, then you should practise a mantra.</p>
<h2> Japa</h2>
<p> Japa is the repetition of a mantra. If you repeat Aum twice,                      thrice or hundreds of times, this repetition is japa. In true                      japa, the seeker has to repeat a particular mantra which is                      given to him by his Master. If he does not have a Master,                      then his mantra can be revealed from within. A seeker can                      also determine inwardly how many times he should repeat his                      mantra if he has no Master to tell him. </p>
<p>If a follower of Japa Yoga needs purity, the Master will                      tell him to repeat a particular mantra a few thousand times                      daily. If he needs mental knowledge, he will have to repeat                      a different mantra. For each divine quality the aspirant wants,                      he must chant a different mantra. The aspirant may have decided                      to repeat the name of God ten or fifteen thousand times, with                      the expectation of a certain result. But while he is chanting                      the name over and over again, he may actually be thinking                      of something else. The lack of one-pointed concentration and                      soulful attention while one is chanting takes away most of                      the effectiveness of the mantra. If you repeat the name of                      God ten thousand times while thinking of something else, you                      cannot expect to get any result. It does not matter how many                      hours you chant if you do not chant sincerely and soulfully.                      But if you do chant properly, then japa can be most effective.</p>
<p> Japa should not be done just before going to bed. If japa                      is done one thousand, two thousand or three thousand times,                      the mind will become agitated because the body wants to enter                      into the world of sleep. The aspirant will repeat “Supreme,                      Supreme, Supreme . . .” but he will only be working                      the mind like a machine. If he continues beyond his capacity,                      his mind will become agitated. Then he will suffer because                      he will not get proper sleep.<br />                     Japa may be done in the morning or during the day. But it                      should be done only one hundred or two hundred or at most                      three hundred times before going to bed. If you forget to                      do japa or do not feel like doing it during the day, and then                      do it all just before going to bed, this is very bad. If you                      meditate before going to bed you will invoke peace, light                      and bliss; but if you do japa one thousand times you will                      invoke power and energy and you will become too tense to sleep.                      <br />                     At times we will discover that we hear the word we have been                      repeating even after we stop. If we continue repeating “Supreme,                      Supreme, Supreme” for some time, when we stop, we will                      hear the same name of God being repeated inside our heart.                      The mouth is not functioning, but the inner being has started                      repeating the mantra naturally and spontaneously. </p>
<p>Japa is not, strictly speaking, a form of meditation. It                      is an invocation. By using a mantra, we can invoke God to                      enter into our inner existence, our inmost self. In meditation                      we try in a broader way to enter into God’s Infinity,                      Eternity and Immortality. </p>
<h2>Using Mantras</h2>
<p> Each mantra offers a particular result. While using a mantra,                      we invoke a certain aspect of God to give us peace, light,                      bliss or something else that we want or need. If we can meditate                      well for ten or fifteen min–utes, this serves the same                      purpose, because we enter into the infinite expanse of peace,                      light and bliss, where our soul can drink whatever it needs                      or wants.</p>
<p> But when aspirants cannot enter into their deepest meditation                      because the mind is restless, this is their opportunity to                      use a mantra. ‘Supreme’, ‘Aum’, or                      ‘God’ can be repeated by anyone for a few minutes                      before starting meditation. The mantra should be repeated                      slowly and aloud. If you want quick results in your inner                      life, repeat a mantra every day without fail, for at least                      half an hour: fifteen minutes in the morning and fifteen minutes                      in the evening. </p>
<h2>The Gayatri Mantra</h2>
<p> Mantras are of two types. One is called dhvani-antak, which                      means ‘with sound’. This mantra comes into existence                      from sound. The other kind is called varnantak, which means                      ‘lettered’. This mantra is called a soundless                      mantra. When two things are struck together we hear a sound.                      But we hear the sound of Aum, the anahata nada or ‘soundless                      sound’, in the inmost recesses of our heart. Ahata means                      struck; anahata means unstruck. Varnantak and anahata are                      the same.</p>
<p> In India we have many mantras. In the Bhagavad-Gita, Sri                      Krishna says that the Gayatri Mantra is the best. Its meaning                      is: “We meditate on the transcendental glory of the                      Deity Supreme, who is inside the heart of the earth, inside                      the life of the sky, and inside the soul of Heaven. May He                      stimulate and illumine our minds.” It is said that if                      one can recite this special mantra one hundred thousand times,                      then all his wishes will be fulfilled. Any desire, any aspiration,                      no matter how mighty, will be fulfilled.</p>
<h2> Seed-Names of Kali and Krishna</h2>
<p> The mantra for the goddess Kali, the Mother of both infinite                      Power and infinite Compassion, is ‘kring’. When                      she is invoked through this seed-name or seed-form, she must                      be invoked in a powerful way. If you can repeat ‘kring’                      most soulfully and powerfully for just fifteen days, you will                      see power and fire all around you. This fire will not burn                      anybody, but people will notice it because it will arouse                      them from their comatose drowsiness.</p>
<p> If you have a great fondness for Krishna, you can invoke                      him by chanting ‘kling’ most sweetly. That is                      his mantra or seed-sound.</p>
<h2> A Mantra for Health</h2>
<p> If you are physically weak, if your physical constitution                      is not satisfactory, chant this mantra sincerely and soulfully:</p>
</p>
<p><em>Tejohasi tejomayi dhehi<br />                     Viryamasi viryam mayi dhehi<br />                     Valam masi valam mayi dhehi</em></p>
<p> In a week’s time you will see a change for the better                      in your health. It means:</p>
<p> I pray for dynamic energy;<br />                     I pray for dynamic virility;<br />                     I pray for indomitable physical strength.</p>
<h2> The Money Mantra</h2>
<p> In this world some people are poor while others are rich.                      Some people are desperately in need of money to make both                      ends meet. Some years ago, a student of mine was having tremendous                      financial difficulties. I gave her a particular mantra:</p>
<p> <em>Ya Devi sarvabhutesu<br />                     Ratna rupena sangstitha<br />                     Nastasvai namastvai<br />                     Namastvai namo namah</em></p>
<p> In thirteen days she came to me and said that her finances                      had tremendously improved. The meaning of this mantra is:</p>
<p> I bow and bow and again I bow to the Supreme Goddess who                      resides in all human beings in the form of material wealth                      and prosperity.</p>
<p> Many people have used this mantra in India. In her case                      it took only thirteen days for the mantra to accomplish its                      purpose. In someone else’s case it may take three months                      or just three days. This particular mantra has tremendous                      power, but it is effective only for bringing material wealth.</p>
<h2>Mantras from the Upanishads</h2>
<p> If you want to remain in supreme Ecstasy and Delight all                      the time, then you will have to chant this particular mantra:</p>
<p> <em>Anandadd hy eva khalv imani bhutani jayante<br />                     Anandena jatani jivanti<br />                     Anandam prayantyabhisam visanti</em></p>
<p> It means:</p>
<p> <em>From Delight we came into existence.<br />                     In Delight we grow.<br />                     At the end of our journey’s close, into<br />                     Delight we retire.</em></p>
<p>If Infinity is the particular object of your aspiration,                      if you want to have infinite Consciousness within and without,                      then the mantra that you have to practise is:</p>
<p> <em>Purnam adah purnam idam<br />                     purnat purnam udacyate<br />                     Purnasya purnam adaya purnam <br />                     evavasisyate </em></p>
<p>It means:</p>
<p> <em>Infinity is that. <br />                     Infinity is this.<br />                     From Infinity, Infinity has come into existence.<br />                     From Infinity, when Infinity is taken away, Infinity remains.</em></p>
<h2>The Seed-Sounds of the Chakras</h2>
<p> There are six major psychic centres in the human body. These                      centres are actually located in the subtle body. For each                      centre there is a seed-sound or mantra. Each word represents                      a state of consciousness, and within each state of consciousness                      there will be a particular symbol, perhaps a flower or an                      animal.</p>
<p> The centre at the base of the spine is called Muladhara.                      If we can repeat the seed word lam while focusing all our                      attention at the base of the spine, in the course of time                      we will open this centre and we will be endowed with the power                      to cure diseases.</p>
<p> A few inches higher, near the spleen, is the Svadhisthana                      centre. If we can repeat the mantra vam while concentrating                      here, we will eventually be endowed with the power to offer                      love to everyone and everything and to receive love from everyone                      and everything.</p>
<p> If we concentrate on the Manipura or navel centre and repeat                      the syllable ram with power and force, we will eventually                      be able to conquer all sorrow and suffering. Also, this centre                      gives us the power to enter into the subtle worlds and higher                      planes.</p>
<p> The mantra yam has to be chanted slowly and sweetly in the                      heart centre, Anahata. If we can open the heart centre, we                      can attain pure joy and the bliss of oneness.</p>
<p> If we chant ham while concentrating on the throat centre,                      Vishuddha, we will receive the power of eloquence in expression                      in all forms of art.</p>
<p> Then we come to the Ajna chakra, which is in the middle                      of the forehead, a little above the base of the nose. There                      the seed-word is Aum. By concentrating on this centre and                      chanting Aum, we can get boundless psychic and occult powers.</p>
<p> The Sahasrara chakra at the crown of the head is considered                      to be the seventh spiritual centre, although it is not linked                      to the other six. When one enters into this crown centre,                      one enters into trance and goes beyond the consciousness of                      this world. The mantra of this centre is Supreme.</p>
<p> There are many other less significant centres in the subtle                      body, but the six I have talked about and the Sahasrara chakra                      are the most important ones. No matter which centre we choose                      to concentrate on or which mantra we repeat, we should try                      to feel a vibration from all the centres. While we are repeating                      a particular mantra, we should try to feel that a current                      is flowing through our spinal cord as if a snake is passing                      through us, and all our centres are being aroused by this                      current. </p>
<h2>The Musical Notes of the Chakras</h2>
<p> The universal Consciousness embodies universal Music. From                      each chakra, where the life-energy from the universal Consciousness                      gathers, a musical note is produced. From Sahasrara the tone                      of shadja or sa is produced. In Western music you call this                      ‘do’. From Ajna, rishava or ri is produced: what                      you call ‘re’. From Vishuddha, gandhara or ga                      is produced: what you call ‘mi’. From Anahata,                      madhyama or ma is produced: what you call ‘fa’.                      From Manipura, panchama or pa is produced: what you call ‘so’.                      From Svadhisthana, dhaivata or dha is produced: what you call                      ‘la’. From Muladhara, nishada or ni is produced:                      what you call ‘ti’. </p>
<h2>Use Mantras with Caution</h2>
<p> I want to make it very clear that the opening of the chakras                      does not mean that one is realising God or that he is about                      to realise God. Not at all! From the highest spiritual point                      of view, the opening of the chakras is like the games a mother                      plays with her children in the playground. The mother knows                      the games will amuse her children.</p>
<p> If the centres are opened without proper purification, the                      seeker will encounter great pain. It will be like playing                      with fire or a sharp knife. He may destroy others or he himself                      may be destroyed. All real spiritual Masters say that it is                      better to open the heart centre first and then try to open                      the other centres. If one opens the heart centre first, there                      is practically no risk. But if one starts with the third eye                      or the lower chakras, it is very dangerous. If one opens up                      the lower chakras without the purification of the vital, especially                      the lower vital, then one can become unbalanced, mad, insane.                      It is like giving a knife to a child. He may misuse it, cutting                      his finger or doing something most harmful and damaging. But                      if one is grown up and mature, then he will use the knife                      to cut fruit and offer it to his friends.</p>
<p><em>How quickly does a mantra remove desire from the mind?</em></p>
<p>It depends on the individual seeker. If he has established                      abundant purity in his being, then it is a matter of months.                      But if the seeker is not pure enough, the mantra may take                      a very long time to produce the necessary effect.</p>
<p>                   <em>Is there a spiritual centre for creative expression, and                    should we concentrate on it before we create?
</p>
<p>                   </em>
<p>The throat chakra is the spiritual centre for art.                      If you can open this centre, then you can be a very good musician                      or a very good artist of any kind. All kinds of artistic capacities                      can be developed from this centre. The difficulty is that                      if your nature is not pure, then if you open this centre and                      become a great artist it will be all for name and fame, and                      all your aspiration will go away. When you open the throat                      centre, if your navel centre and lower centres are not properly                      purified, then as soon as you create something, worldly appreciation                      will lower your consciousness. It may happen that you will                      only create for world applause and not with the idea of serving                      God through your creation. If you cannot have the inner assurance                      of purity, the best thing is to pray to the Supreme to purify                      you and illumine your consciousness so that you will not fall                      from the spiritual life when you get boundless artistic capacity                      by opening this chakra. But if you have consciously established                      a certain standard of peace, light and bliss in your life,                      then you can safely open this centre and create something                      beautiful, meaningful and everlasting.</p>
<p> <em>Is it only the throat chakra that enables us to become                      artists or musicians?</em></p>
<p>If you concentrate on the throat chakra, you will be able                      to become a very good artist, musician, writer, dancer or                      singer. This does not mean that the other centres do not have                      the capacity to help you in this way, but the throat centre                      has the utmost capacity. When you sing, you may feel an awakening                      in the throat centre. Those who have good voices have, to                      some extent, opened their throat centre. This is a very good                      experience.</p>
<p> Whoever has mastery over the throat chakra has the capacity                      to offer divine messages to the world. We get messages from                      various planes of consciousness. But when one gets a message                      from the throat chakra, the message is sublime and everlasting.                      When this centre is open, one receives direct messages from                      the Highest and becomes a mouthpiece for the Highest. One                      becomes a poet, a singer or an artist. All forms of art are                      expressed from this centre.</p>
