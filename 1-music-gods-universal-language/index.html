<p align="center"><em>If we can feel that<br />                     It is not our voice,<br />                     Not our fingers,<br />                     But some reality deep inside our heart<br />                     Which is expressing itself,<br />                     Then we will know that it is<br />                     The soul’s music.</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>The outer music<br />                     Comes from an outer instrument.<br />                     The inner music<br />                     Comes from the heart.<br />                     The name of this inner music<br />                     Is oneness.</em></p>
<p>Music is the inner or universal language of God. I do not                      know French or German or Italian. But if music is played,                      immediately the heart of the music enters into my heart, or                      my heart enters into the music. At that time, we do not need                      outer communication; the inner communion of the heart is enough.                      My heart is communing with the heart of the music and in our                      communion we become inseparably one.</p>
<p> In the spiritual world, next to meditation is music, the                      breath of music. Meditation is silence, energising and fulfilling.                      Silence is the eloquent expression of the inexpressible. Aldous                      Huxley says: “After silence, that which comes nearest                      to expressing the inexpressible is music.” </p>
<p>Silence is the source of everything. It is the source of                      music and it is music itself. Silence is the deepest, most                      satisfying music of the Supreme. </p>
<p>Silence is like a stream that goes to one place and becomes                      a river, or to another place and becomes a brook, or to the                      sea where it is totally expanded. </p>
<p>Silence is the nest and music is the bird. The bird leaves                      the nest early in the morning and returns to the nest in the                      evening. Similarly, in the spiritual world, divine music comes                      from the inmost soul of silence.</p>
<h2>Soulful Music</h2>
<p>Soulful music immediately awakens and inspires our hearts                      because it embodies the Absolute Supreme. Soulful music is                      the Light that wants to express itself in a divine way. Even                      as darkness wants to manifest its authority on earth, Light                      also wants to manifest its Reality and Divinity in a specific                      way. Light is the soul of everything. Light is the soul of                      music, Light is the soul of love and Light is the soul of                      all art. When Light divinely manifests itself in the form                      of music, it is the music of the soul. </p>
<p>Music means Self-expansion and oneness. The Self expands                      through music. The Self that expands is not the individual                      self but the unlimited Self. Music is the expansion of unlimited                      Reality. </p>
<p>We can use music to help us in our spiritual life provided                      we know that music and the spiritual life are like twin brothers;                      we cannot separate them. How can we separate two fingers,                      two eyes? They sit side by side. If one eye is not functioning                      well, then we feel that our vision is imperfect. Similarly,                      music and the spiritual life must go together; one complements                      the other. Music helps the spiritual seeker to go deep within                      to get the utmost satisfaction from life, from truth, from                      reality. The spiritual life, in turn, helps music to offer                      its capacity and its strength, which is the soul’s light,                      to the world at large.</p>
<p> When we listen to soulful music, or when we ourselves play                      soulful music, immediately our inner existence climbs up high,                      higher, highest. It climbs up and enters into something beyond.                      This Beyond is constantly trying to help us, guide us, mould                      us and shape us into our true transcendental image, our true                      divinity. When we hear soulful music, or when we play a soulful                      piece of music, we feel a kind of inner thrill in our entire                      existence, from the soles of our feet to the crown of our                      head. A river is flowing through us, a river of consciousness,                      and this consciousness is all the time illumined.</p>
<h2>Music and Meditation</h2>
<p> Next to deep prayer or meditation, music is of paramount                      importance. Meditation is like a direct route, or shortcut,                      to the goal. Music is a road that is absolutely clear: it                      may be a little longer, but it is quite clear of obstacles.                      If we can play soulful music or hear soulful music, the power                      of our meditation increases. Soulful music adds to our aspiration.                      Similarly, if a spiritual seeker wants to be a musician, even                      if he does not have a musical background, he will be able                      to be a good musician because prayer and meditation contain                      all capacities. You may never have studied music, but if you                      pray and meditate soulfully, then inside your prayer, inside                      your meditation, by the Grace of the Supreme, the power of                      music looms large. Then you can utilise this power in your                      own way.<br />                     Each time soulful music is played, we get inspiration and                      delight. In the twinkling of an eye, music can elevate our                      consciousness. But if we also pray and meditate, then we are                      undoubtedly more illumined and fulfilled than a music-lover                      who is not consciously leading a spiritual life. Each spiritual                      musician is consciously spreading God’s Light on earth.                      God is the cosmic Player, the eternal Player, and we are His                      instruments. It is the Supreme who makes the proper instrument.                      Then, it is He who makes the player play properly, and it                      is He who makes the musician.</p>
<h2> The Power of Music </h2>
<p>Soulful and spiritual music really helps us; it feeds our                      inner life. Music has tremendous power. With fire we can burn                      ourselves, or we can cook and do many other good things. It                      is the same with music. Divine music immediately elevates                      our consciousness, whereas undivine music immediately lowers                      our consciousness and tries to destroy our sincere inner cry                      for a better spiritual life. The spiritual person will immediately                      be affected by this music. So music can change our consciousness                      provided it is the music that comes from the heart and enters                      into the heart. The music that touches the very depth of our                      heart can elevate our consciousness. </p>
<h2>The Mind and the Senses</h2>
<p> Our senses are restless. Therefore, our mind suffers. Our                      mind is doubtful. Therefore, our senses suffer. The mind has                      no capacity to bind or discipline the senses. Here music comes                      to the mind’s rescue. With the help of music, the mind                      binds and disciplines the senses and makes them into perfect                      instruments so they can be inundated with peace, light and                      bliss from above. </p>
<p>Again, when the mind is doubtful, when the mind drinks deep                      of doubt-poison, the senses have no capacity to inject faith                      into the mind. Here also music comes to the rescue. The senses                      take help from music to transform and illumine themselves.                      When the senses are calm and quiet, the doubtful mind is totally                      transformed and it becomes inseparably one with the heart,                      which is all receptivity. At that time our Inner Pilot—the                      Supreme Musician—can manifest Himself blessingfully,                      powerfully and measurelessly. As He is manifesting Himself                      in and through us, the divine music becomes part and parcel                      of our existence and we grow into perfect Perfection. In and                      through us the Supreme Musician creates a new world. We become                      the divine music, and a new vision of God’s transcendental                      Reality operates in and through us. </p>
<p> <em>Can spiritual music be played during meditation?</em></p>
<p> Certainly, although it depends on the one who meditates.                      There are many seekers on earth who meditate extremely well,                      but who have not developed their musical sense. Their ears                      have not been trained, so we cannot expect them to change                      their nature overnight. They either lack the capacity of appreciation                      or they have some austere feeling about music. Psychic music                      is not very widely appreciated, and very few people appreciate                      the soul’s music. They feel it is like a stranger that                      is entering into their consciousness. But it is actually their                      eternal tenant, their soul, that is deep within them waiting                      to come to the fore.</p>
<p> If divine music is played during deep meditation, it enhances                      the meditation. It will immediately help in elevating the                      consciousness. If you are fond of music, then playing soulful                      songs or chants during your meditations at home will definitely                      help you.</p>
<p> <em>Were we to play spiritual music on tape while we slept,                      would it benefit us in any way?</em></p>
<p> While you are sleeping if you play soulful music, your subtle                      vital, subtle physical and subtle mind will enjoy it. But                      your physical body may find it difficult to appreciate it,                      for it wants total silence. Although soulful music will add                      to pure silence, inner silence, the physical body wants a                      kind of silence which is totally devoid of outer sound.</p>
<p> If you play your tape very softly, it will definitely help                      and inspire the subtle physical and subtle vital which are                      not sleeping.</p>
<p> Many, many times when the physical sleeps, the subtle physical                      and the subtle vital do not sleep. They move around. They                      roam here and there. They visit their friends and enemies.                      My music is definitely a source of joy to them. So for the                      subtle physical, subtle vital and subtle mind, undoubtedly                      it is a help. But for the gross physical which is trying to                      sleep, it may be a hindrance, a disaster. </p>
<p> <em>What is the supreme duty of an artist or musician?</em></p>
<p> The supreme duty of an artist or musician is to meditate                      before he creates something and, while creating, to be in                      a very contemplative, divine mood. Then, when the creation                      is completed, he will immediately offer his creation to the                      Supreme. No matter what others say about his creation, no                      matter what his feelings are about his own creation, as soon                      as his creation is completed, he will offer it to the Supreme                      for Him to use in His own way. This is the supreme duty of                      the spiritual musician or artist.</p>
<p> <em>Is creativity another form of meditation?</em></p>
<p> It depends on what you are creating. If it is spiritual                      art or music, then certainly it is a form of meditation. But                      if you play undivine music or write unbearable books or keep                      your mind in the gutter while you are painting, this is not                      any kind of meditation. While you are creating, if your consciousness                      is in the lower vital world, it will not be a form of meditation.                      But if you are singing something soulful or if you are in                      a very high consciousness while you are creating, if you are                      giving yourself in a divine way to the object or subject that                      you are involved with, then definitely you are doing a form                      of meditation. You have to know what you are creating and                      where your consciousness is while you are doing it. </p>
<p> I am giving a lot of importance to aspiring through music.<br />                     There is nothing wrong if you feel aspiration in your music.                      But you have to know how many hours you can think of your                      music. If you spend five hours, six hours, seven hours a day                      on music, then you should spend one hour or two hours, let                      us say, on spirituality. Music is also a form of spirituality;                      I do not deny it. But the height that you will achieve from                      meditation either you may not get or cannot get from your                      music. Music is an added help. </p>
<p>If you can play spiritual music, soulful music, then you                      will have no problem in your life. But if you play only mundane                      music, then you may not be satisfied. You may be pleasing                      the outer world, but you are not pleasing your Inner Pilot                      in His own way. If you are not an aspiring seeker, that is                      fine. But if you are a sincere seeker, then you will feel                      miserable. </p>
<p> <em>When I play music, I feel a tingling around my third                      eye.</em></p>
<p> That indicates an awakening. But this does not mean that                      your third eye is about to open. No. When you play most soulfully,                      an inner vision-light will come to the fore. Vision is within                      you, yet it is dormant. But now it wants to function properly;                      it does not want to sleep anymore. So inner vision is starting                      to operate. The vision of the third eye is trying to come                      to the fore, and that is why you are getting that sensation.                      It is a very good experience.</p>
<p> <em>What is the soundless sound, and can it serve as a bridge                      between the manifest and the unmanifest worlds?</em></p>
<p> As it stands now the outer world is not at all aware of                      the inner world. So first the outer world has to be fully                      aware of the inner world, and then it has to listen to the                      blessingful dictates of the inner world. Then the soundless                      sound—which is now heard only by very, very few Truth-seekers                      and God-lovers—can be of divine service to mankind.                      It is an inner discovery. This discovery has to be brought                      to the fore, and for that the outer world has to be consciously                      awakened and devotedly accept the beauty and divinity of the                      inner world.</p>
<p> The soundless sound is something real, absolutely real.                      But we hear it only in our highest realm of consciousness,                      or when we dive deep within and reach the inmost recesses                      of our heart. The soundless sound is infinitely, infinitely                      more powerful than any man-made sound. But up to now, it has                      been operating only in the inner world. So those who have                      a free access to the inner world can hear this sound. Not                      only do they derive tangible benefit from this sound, but                      it helps the seekers and God-lovers immensely in their self-giving                      life to God the Creator and God the creation.</p>
